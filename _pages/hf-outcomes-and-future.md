The effectiveness of the game-based learning intervention was measured using a two-pronged approach, capturing both immediate self-reported metrics and delayed behavioral integration data.

## Immediate Educational Impact

The workshop yielded significant improvements across key metrics.

* **Understanding of Application:** Student self-rated understanding of how to apply Human Factors to clinical practice increased from an average baseline of 2.45/10 to 8.19/10 post-workshop.
* **Theoretical Knowledge:** Self-rated knowledge of Human Factors theory improved from an average of 2.24/10 to 7.69/10.
* **Student Reception:** The overall workshop rating was 8.88/10. Students overwhelmingly found the session fun, engaging, and highly unique.

## Long-Term Clinical Integration

To evaluate true pedagogical success, a follow-up survey was deployed two months post-workshop to students. Among the 20 respondents, 50% reported that experiences on clinical placement caused them to explicitly recall the workshop.

The qualitative data provided strong evidence of behavioral change and improved situational awareness:

* Students actively identified clinicians experiencing "tunnel vision" and failing to step back to assess the big picture.
* Students recognized the negative impact of environmental distractions, such as noise interference, on general practice consultations.
* One student applied the workshop principles to analyze a near-miss where a consultant communicated a diagnosis to the wrong patient after mishearing a bed number (cubicle 8 versus bed 8).
* Students also reported using the theoretical framework to depersonalize negative interactions, attributing unfriendly staff behavior to systemic human factors rather than personal failings.

## Future Developments and Scalability

The project is embedded into the 9-week "Acute and Critical Care" block for final year medical students for the 2025/26 academic year at the South Bristol Academy.

**Sustainability Strategy:**
The intervention is designed for high scalability with low set-up costs. A "Train the Trainer" programme and a comprehensive delivery guide have been produced to ensure consistent facilitation across different cohorts. Future expansion targets include post-graduate doctors, nursing staff, allied health professionals, and lay people.

**Artificial Intelligence Integration:**
To further enhance the educational feedback loop, a custom AI Agent is being considered for development. This would utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transcription and extract specific conversational examples from the gameplay. This system would be intended to generate automated feedback summaries for students via email, evaluate facilitator performance, and provide real-time feedback to facilitators during the session.
