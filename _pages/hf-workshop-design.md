The "Defusing Tension" workshop utilizes an inductive, experience-first pedagogical model. It immediately immerses students in a high-stress, simulated environment to generate authentic behavioral data, which then serves as the primary evidence for analyzing and reflecting on established scientific principles later in the session.

## Part 1: Experiential Learning through Simulation
The workshop begins with a high-stakes, co-operative simulation using the video game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". This non-clinical exercise serves as a catalyst for experiential learning. By placing students in a neutral, high-pressure environment, the pedagogy removes the cognitive load of medical terminology and clinical judgment. This allows students to focus entirely on the core mechanics of communication, teamwork, and leadership without the distraction of their primary field of study.

In this phase, students experience the visceral reality of time-pressured decision-making. They must develop immediate strategies for relaying information between a "Defuser" and "Experts" in order to defuse a virtual bomb. The chaos of the game naturally generates examples of communication breakdown, task saturation, and leadership vacuums, which provide the raw material for the subsequent theoretical analysis.

## Part 2: Theoretical Synthesis and Clinical Application
Following the practical session, the workshop transitions into a formal examination of human error models. Students are introduced to Gordon DuPont's "Dirty Dozen". This framework was developed by a Canadian aviation expert in the 1990s and outlines twelve common preconditions for error in safety critical industries. The concepts are: communication, complacency, lack of knowledge, distraction, lack of teamwork, fatigue, lack of resources, pressure, lack of assertiveness, stress, situational awareness, and cultural norms.

To anchor these concepts in healthcare, students apply the framework to the Resus Council UK video case study, "Just a Routine Operation". Having just experienced similar pressures in the simulation, students can more effectively analyze the incident:

* **Situational Awareness and Stress:** Students identify how stress caused the consultants to develop tunnel vision on repeat intubation attempts. They draw parallels to their own experience of losing track of time during the game.

* **Teamwork and Communication:** Participants observe the breakdown in decision-making when multiple consultants provide input without an established leader. This mirrors the coordination challenges they faced during the earlier puzzle.

* **Lack of Assertiveness:** Students reflect on the impact of hierarchy. They note that the nurses in the case study did not voice their concerns aloud, just as some students may have felt hesitant to challenge a peer's instructions during the simulation.

## Evaluative Outcomes
Student feedback confirmed that this instructional sequence is highly effective. One participant noted that performing tasks that demonstrate human factors meant that when they learned the formal theory later, the topic felt familiar rather than foreign. Others praised the use of gamification to create an engaging, real-life simulation that allowed them to practice essential non-medical skills in a safe yet demanding context.
