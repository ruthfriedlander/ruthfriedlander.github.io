The "Defusing Tension" workshop employs a highly analytical, blended pedagogical approach. It grounds students in established scientific disciplines before immersing them in a high-stress, simulated environment to actively test those principles.

## Part 1: Establishing the Theoretical Framework

The session begins by introducing students to established models of human error, specifically Gordon DuPont's "Dirty Dozen". Developed by a Canadian aviation expert in the 1990s, this framework outlines twelve common preconditions for human error in safety-critical industries. Students are introduced to concepts including communication, complacency, lack of knowledge, distraction, lack of teamwork, fatigue, lack of resources, pressure, lack of assertiveness, stress, situational awareness, and cultural norms.

To anchor this theory in clinical reality, students analyse the well-known ResusCouncilUK video case study, "Just a Routine Operation". They systematically break down the incident using the "Dirty Dozen" framework:

* **Situational Awareness and Stress:** Students identify how stress caused the consultants to develop "tunnel vision" on repeat intubation attempts, causing them to lose sight of the bigger picture.
* **Teamwork and Communication:** Students observe the breakdown in decision-making because all three consultants provided input without a clear team leader being established.
* **Lack of Assertiveness:** Students note the impact of perceived hierarchy, observing that nurses brought the emergency airway kit into the room but did not voice their concerns aloud when it remained unutilised.

## Part 2: Co-operative Game-Based Learning

To move beyond passive didactic lectures, the workshop incorporates the co-operative puzzle video game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes".

This non-clinical simulation acts as a catalyst for experiential learning. The pedagogy relies on removing the cognitive load of medical terminology and clinical judgment. By placing the exercise in a non-medical context, students can focus entirely on the core mechanics of communication, teamwork, and leadership under pressure.

Student feedback highlighted the success of this instructional sequence. One student noted that doing tasks demonstrating human factors meant that when they learned the formal theory later, it did not feel like a foreign topic. Another student appreciated the opportunity to practice the essential skills required of a doctor in a non-medical manner, while others praised the use of gamification to create a highly engaging, real-life simulation.
