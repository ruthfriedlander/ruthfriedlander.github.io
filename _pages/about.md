I am a Clinical Education Fellow in Emergency Medicine at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston (UHBW), combining frontline Emergency Department practice with innovative educational design for undergraduate medical students.

## About Me

With a primary clinical focus on **Emergency Medicine** and a specialised expertise in **Undergraduate Medical Education**, I work closely with University of Bristol medical students in their clinical years to develop their skills in acute and emergency care. I hold a **MBChB with Distinction** from the University of Bristol and am registered with the **General Medical Council** (Full Registration with Licence to Practise).

## Medical Education & Simulation

A significant part of my career is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of how we teach clinical skills:

- **Human Factors & Gamification** — I created an award-winning "gamified" Human Factors workshop using co-operative game-based learning, presented nationally at DEMEC 2025 and a finalist for the ASME Teaching Innovation and Excellence (TIE) Prize 2025.
- **Simulation Leadership** — I act as Faculty for Trust simulation courses and have designed high-fidelity "Mass Casualty" and "Plane Sim" exercises.
- **Undergraduate Teaching** — I manage weekly bedside teaching for Year 3 students and deliver core lectures on Acute Medicine and Trauma.
- **Curriculum Design** — I created a regional Human Factors Teaching Day for Foundation Doctors.

## Quality Improvement & Leadership

- **Resident Doctor Audit Lead** for the Bristol Royal Infirmary Emergency Department, overseeing audit alignment with national standards and CQC priorities.
- **Time Critical Medication QIP** — Collaborated with Pharmacy Informatics to build a bespoke data collection tool for robust departmental performance reporting.

## Volunteering

I am an active volunteer with **St John Ambulance** as a Demonstrator/Educator and Event Doctor, delivering over 50 hours of community training in 2025.
