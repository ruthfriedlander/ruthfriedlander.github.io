I am a Clinical Education Fellow in Emergency Medicine at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston (UHBW), working closely with Bristol University medical students in their clinical years to develop their skills in acute and emergency medicine.

I have a keen interest in MedEd and Simulation, and am currently leading a programme with Final Year students exploring the use of "Gamification" to teach Human Factors principles.

In addition to this role, I am an active volunteer with St John Ambulance as a Demonstrator/Educator and Event Doctor.

## Interests

- **Medical Education** — curriculum design, clinical teaching, and assessment
- **Simulation** — high-fidelity and in-situ simulation for clinical training
- **Human Factors** — gamification approaches to teaching non-technical skills
- **Emergency Medicine** — acute care and emergency department education
- **St John Ambulance** — volunteering as Demonstrator/Educator and Event Doctor
