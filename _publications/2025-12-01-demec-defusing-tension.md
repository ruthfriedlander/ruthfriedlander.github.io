National oral abstract presenting the design, delivery, and outcomes of an innovative "gamified" Human Factors workshop for final year medical students. The workshop uses the co-operative puzzle game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" to teach non-technical skills including communication, teamwork, and situational awareness in a non-clinical context.

The workshop demonstrated significant improvements in students' self-rated understanding of Human Factors application (2.45/10 → 8.19/10) and theoretical knowledge (2.24/10 → 7.69/10), with an overall session rating of 8.88/10.
