Regional presentation on the application of Human Factors principles to clinical practice. Drew on experience from the “Defusing Tension” gamified workshop programme and its integration into the undergraduate curriculum at the South Bristol Academy. Pilot data from the workshop were presented, demonstrating significant improvements in students’ self-rated knowledge, alongside exceptionally high engagement and satisfaction scores. Preliminary follow-up data from the second year of the programme were also presented, suggesting that these positive outcomes have been sustained. Concluded by outlining plans for the workshop’s incorporation into a Regional Teaching Day for Severn Foundation School Trainees.
