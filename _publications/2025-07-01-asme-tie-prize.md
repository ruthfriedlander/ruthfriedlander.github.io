This talk presented pilot data from a new and innovative educational project: a game-based Human Factors workshop designed and delivered for final-year medical students at South Bristol Academy (University of Bristol). Developed from scratch to address a clear gap in formal Human Factors training prior to graduation, the workshop adapts a high-pressure, communication-focused “bomb defusal” game and overlays three bespoke Human Factors challenges that simulate real clinical pressures. 
The talk outlined the rationale, design process, and practical delivery of the workshop, alongside initial evaluation data demonstrating substantial improvements in students’ self-rated knowledge and exceptionally high engagement and satisfaction scores, alongside positive evidence of long-term impact.
